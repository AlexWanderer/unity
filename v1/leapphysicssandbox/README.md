Leap Physics Sandbox
=========

##Description

Here's an example of how you can easily get really cool physical interactions using Unity3D + Leap Motion.

I'm using the Leap hand controller code included with the default UnitySandbox in the SDK with some slight modifications. I also have a bit of code demonstrating basic scene navigation by "panning" the ground.

I then setup physics toys in the scene using Unity's built in physics engine.

There are a few simple physics toys I've setup in this sandbox.
